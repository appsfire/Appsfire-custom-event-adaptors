## Getting Started with Appsfire
The Appsfire SDK is the cornerstone of the Appsfire network.

It provides the functionalities for monetizing your mobile application: it facilitates inserting native mobile ads into you application using native APIs. You can choose one of our ad units (Sushi, Uramaki and Sashimi), or create a new custom ad format (based on the Sashimi Ad Unit). Be sure to read our [full documentation](http://docs.appsfire.com/).

It also helps you engage with your users by sending push and in-app notifications.
