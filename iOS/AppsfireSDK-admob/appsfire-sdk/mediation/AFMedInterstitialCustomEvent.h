 * The Appsfire iOS SDK mediates third party Ad Networks using custom events. The custom events are
 * responsible for instantiating and manipulating objects in the third party SDK and translating
 * and communicating events from those objects back to the Appsfire SDK by notifying a delegate.
 *
 * By implementing this protocol on your custom event class you can enable the Appsfire SDK to
 * natively support a wide variety of third-party ad networks.
 *
 * At runtime, the Appsfire SDK will find and instantiate your custom event class that implements
 * the AFMedInterstitialCustomEvent protocol and will invoke the
 * `-requestInterstitialWithCustomParameters:` method.
